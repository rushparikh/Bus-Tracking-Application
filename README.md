# Bus-Tracking-Application

The mobile app will prompt the user for bus service (28X, 71B, 71D, etc) and then get results from Port Authority using their BusTime API to display the predicted time for the next stop for the bus service.


The user selects the bus number, direction (Inbound/Outbound) and the bus stop and depending on the selection the App will display the next arrival time for that service.


Backend: Java Servlet,
Dashboard: JSP pages and
MongoDB to store user actions
